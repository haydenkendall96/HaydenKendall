		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my one of my first succesful neural networks written in the Python programing language. It is an approach to the LeNet - 5 CNN solution created by Yann Lecun in 1998. 
		The Network is written entirely in Python by me using only the library NumPy for assistance with the calculation of matrices. The simple user interface is written in C#. 
		The network consists of seven total layers which are used to identify images of hand-written numbers from the MNIST dataset. The first four are feature maps to learn identification 'features' via backpropogation. The final three layers are the traditional feed-forward 
		neural networks that compute a 'best-guess' when the final stage of the feature map data is flattened. This network's weights are also calculated over time using backpropogation.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bit of a side project I decided to work on. I built a simple app for grocery shopping to further get accustomed to iOS development and sending data over networks. 
		This was a great learning experience for understanding client-server communication with HTTP and how networking can be a helpful tool in using smart phones to their full potential. 
		I update an excel spreadsheet at home of what I need. Using server-side programming, the data can be requested on the iPhone app and displayed when I arrive at the store. 
		It also calculates spending (something I personally do often while shopping).

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first assignment in the CSC 412 course: Operating Systems and Networks. The primary focus of this project was to 
		get a first look at the Oracle VirtualBox program, set up a virtual machine of Ubuntu, learn simple Unix commands, and to get an idea for the format of 
		future assignments. The assignment started out by asking for a series of images to display adequate following of the instructions. The first image being that the virtual machine has 
		enough memory, processors allocated, and was overall setup correctly. The instructions of the assignment call for various uses and exposure to basic Unix commands that one may need such as
		making directories, creating .txt files while passing data to them, deleting files, and editing in a nano text editor.  The command history is then pulled and stored in a history.txt files that is 
		then edited in the nano editor to add my full name as the first line. <a href = "history.txt">History</a>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment took an introductory look into C code syntax and bash shell scripting. The combination of these two concepts resulted in a program that outputs a sequence of Fibonacci numbers given a primed input by the user. The program then generates text files containing the summations in a directory named “Results”. In addition to the base requirements, the extra credit opportunities were also fulfilled. This resulted in a program that also moves the contents of “Results” to a new directory named “Results_n”, depending on the number of n folders already in existence. To comply
		with academic honesty, my code may be requested for review only by an accredited instituion or organization. This was an assignment that was turned in poorly completed and was redone by me for personal 
		self-education. PDF of assignment description will not be given either to comply with plagiarism and academic honesty. Link to report: <a href = "Report02.pdf">Report</a>
