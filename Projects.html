		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my one of my first succesful neural networks written in the Python programing language. It is an approach to the LeNet - 5 CNN solution created by Yann Lecun in 1998. 
		The Network is written entirely in Python by me using only the library NumPy for assistance with the calculation of matrices. The simple user interface is written in C#. 
		The network consists of seven total layers which are used to identify images of hand-written numbers from the MNIST dataset. The first four are feature maps to learn identification 'features' via backpropogation. The final three layers are the traditional feed-forward 
		neural networks that compute a 'best-guess' when the final stage of the feature map data is flattened. This network's weights are also calculated over time using backpropogation.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have my personal website running, and I've read some more neural network material, I can get back to a project I've been looking at for some time.
		My goal is to build a sequence to sequence model for a basic chatbot using Recurrent Neural Networks. More specifically using a Long Short-Term Memory Cell(LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU). 
		Most likely, I'll be using a GRU to be conservative with computer power.
