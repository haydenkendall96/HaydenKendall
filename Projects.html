		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my one of my first successful neural networks written in the Python programing language. It is an approach to the LeNet - 5 CNN solution created by Yann Lecun in 1998. 
		The Network is written entirely in Python by me using only the library NumPy for assistance with the calculation of matrices. The simple user interface is written in C#. 
		The network consists of seven total layers which are used to identify images of hand-written numbers from the MNIST dataset. The first four are feature maps to learn identification 'features' via backpropogation. The final three layers are the traditional feed-forward 
		neural networks that compute a 'best-guess' when the final stage of the feature map data is flattened. This network's weights are also calculated over time using backpropogation.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bit of a side project I decided to work on. I built a simple app for grocery shopping to further get accustomed to iOS development and sending data over networks. 
		This was a great learning experience for understanding client-server communication with HTTP and how networking can be a helpful tool in using smart phones to their full potential. 
		I update an excel spreadsheet at home of what I need. Using server-side programming, the data can be requested on the iPhone app and displayed when I arrive at the store. 
		It also calculates spending (something I personally do often while shopping).

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first assignment in the CSC 412 course: Operating Systems and Networks. The primary focus of this project was to 
		get a first look at the Oracle VirtualBox program, set up a virtual machine of Ubuntu, learn simple Unix commands, and to get an idea for the format of 
		future assignments. The assignment started out by asking for a series of images to display adequate following of the instructions. The first image being that the virtual machine has 
		enough memory, processors allocated, and was overall setup correctly. The instructions of the assignment call for various uses and exposure to basic Unix commands that one may need such as
		making directories, creating .txt files while passing data to them, deleting files, and editing in a nano text editor.  The command history is then pulled and stored in a history.txt files that is 
		then edited in the nano editor to add my full name as the first line. <a href = "history.txt">History</a>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment took an introductory look into C code syntax and bash shell scripting. 
		The combination of these two concepts resulted in a program that outputs a sequence of Fibonacci numbers given a primed input by the user. 
		The program then generates text files containing the summations in a directory named “Results”. In addition to the base requirements, 
		the extra credit opportunities were also fulfilled. This resulted in a program that also moves the contents of “Results” to a new directory named “Results_n”,
		depending on the number of n folders already in existence. This was an assignment that was turned in poorly completed and was redone by me for personal self-education.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This programming assignment emphasized parallel processing. This is a fundamental concept used in modern operating systems.
		Generally, I like to take no more than a week or two on these assignments but I did get caught up on some spring cleaning so I was delayed about a week. I found this project to be at a much higher difficulty(as expected) than the last assignment.
		I think that not only was this a project looking at operating system concepts, but a fundamental look in how the C language works. While this was a project I feel I could probably complete in a short time with other languages, it was appropriate enough
		that it required a level of self-teaching to nuances of memory management and pointers. Due to that, I think I was a bit slower this first time around. While this was challenging, I did find enjoyment out of solving the problems and learning many new techniques in computer science. 
		I anticipate the next project to be a bit quicker with my new knowledge of C. I may take some extra time to complete assignment 04 as I'm in the process of buying a new computer.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next project in this course was one that had a fairly practical function to it. We were tasked with creating a high dynamic range photo off of an overexposed, underexposed, and correctly exposed
		image. The assignment then called for the students to thread a sub-image based on the number argument passed to the system. Threading is incredibly useful in that it is unlike parallel processing where the code can be executed simultaneously
		at it's smallest sequence. Especially in the case of image processing where data can be quite large at times. Unfortunately, I was not able to get my new laptop and had to cancel my order. Apple is updating their 
		laptops with a new ARM architecture so I found it sort of silly to buy (not cheap!) a new computer for programming and general work. Delayed on my work for a wasteful reason but I hope it's worth the wait! Also my original recording
		didn't seem to be successful and I haven't had the chance to make a new recording. This was completed on the 15th of July originally.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a bit distracted in my reading between projects. My latest book was <i>Structured Computer Organization</i> by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. He is a fantastic author! Even reading pretty much every day,  
	     I was dragged in for about a month (minus one week when my dad visited). I found it to be incredibly informative for understanding computer architecture and the different levels of organization. I think my CSC 411 course will be the next
		 I review after my final project for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this project and it likely has been favorite so far in CSC 412. This had to do with resource management, which is very necessary in modern operating systems, as processes
		 all attempt to complete their job with haste. It comprised of a simulation of travelers that each ate away at ink levels to draw their trails across the screen. The problem was that only one traveler could access the ink tanks at a time in order to prevent a race condition.
		 I also believe this has been my most elegant C programmed assignment thus far.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it's nice to be finished with my review of operating systems and C. I have to say I'm rather proud of myself for going through each individual assignment on my own. 
			I'm happy knowing that I had the motivation to finish despite the random delays or distractions during my study. Reflecting on it too, I feel as though my time was well spent. I've gained a 
			serious amount of knowledge regarding operating system but also skills that I will be using in my profession as a programmer. I think for the time being I'm going to be taking a break from strictly
			programming to focus on studyig Linear Algebra. It'll be nice to have a break from the screen for a bit.
