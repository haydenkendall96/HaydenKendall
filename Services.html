	Yawgoog Scout Reservation is widely regarded as being the second oldest Boy Scout camp in the country. Located in Rockville, Rhode Island, this used to be my summer job while in high school and university.
	My first six years of employment I worked in what was called the Camp Craft Center. This was the department where boys(10 - 17 years.) would go to learn everything to be a Boy Scout. 
	Here I taught the Camping, Cooking, Rope-Works, Wilderness Survival, and Orienteering merit badge. These classes were held lecture style in an outdoor setting that had planned syllabi with additional demonstrations 
	and hands-on experiences planned for the boys. My sixth year I held a more administrative role in managing the department as whole with a co-manager and 10 additional staff. My final year I worked at the food warehouse part-time.

	AMP Academy is a Parkour, Ninja Warrior, and Capoeira school located in Fall River, Massachusetts. I worked here as a Parkour/Ninja-Warrior coach teaching adult and kid classes along with the owner/head-coach.
	I managed classes of anywhere between 10-30 people as early as four years old and helped develop lesson plans for each weekly class consisting of acrobatics, agilitiy, and strength. 
	Here my focus was maintaining safety above all, but designing fun and challenging experiences for people of all ages. 
	My students were able to learn to jump, flip, climb, and overcome any obstacle thrown their way in a safe and reasonable approach.
